        <p class="info">I was born and raised in <strong><a href = "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Massachusetts/@42.0150798,-73.9266141,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e3656de973bffd:0x45c6d03655830d1c!8m2!3d42.4072107!4d-71.3824374" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a></strong> and grew up in a small town about 45 minutes south of Boston. I have two brothers, one of which is a Software Engineer as well! Growing up, I played soccer at a high level and enjoyed spending time with my friends and family. I love being active and going to the gym too! 
        <hr />
        <p class="info2">I am currently a full time student at Coding Temple and very excited to gain knowledge and pursue Software Development as a career. I decided to pursue this career after having worked as a General Manager in gyms for most of my 20's. What excites me the most is the amount of possibilities and innovative things you can do with software development. I look forward to this exciting journey!</p>
